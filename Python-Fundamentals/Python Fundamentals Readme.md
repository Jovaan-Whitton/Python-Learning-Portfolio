#  Python Fundamentals â€“ From Basics to Building a Game

##  Overview

This repository documents my journey through Python fundamentals â€” from learning how to assign variables and handle user input, to building functions, using control flow, and completing a capstone project: a **Number Guessing Game**.

This project started with beginner-level exercises and mini-challenges to reinforce each concept. It concludes with an interactive game that applies the core principles I learned along the way.

##  Project Structure

###  Step 1: Variable Assignment
Learned how to declare and assign values to variables using `=` and printed outputs using `print()`.

###  Step 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations
Performed operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using Python operators.

###  Step 3: User Input
Collected user input using `input()` and converted input data types using functions like `int()` and `str()`.

### Step 4: List Data Types
Understood tha basics of the list data type using `[]` to  and how to index specific values from a list.

### Step 5: Conditional Statements
Used `if`, `elif`, and `else` to add logic to programs. Learned to compare values, make decisions, and respond dynamically

###  Step 6: Function Creation
Defined reusable blocks of logic using `def`. Practiced writing, calling, and nesting functions.

###  Step 7: Loops and Iteration
Used `while` loops to repeat actions until a condition was met and `for` loops to iterate through a list of values. Combined loops with conditionals and user input to build interactive behavior.

##  Capstone Project: Number Guessing Game

###  Game Description

The final challenge brings everything together into a playable terminal-based game:

- A random number between 1 and 100 is generated
- The player enters guesses through input
- The game provides feedback ("Too high", "Too low", or "Correct")
- A counter tracks the number of attempts
- The loop continues until the user wins

###  Concepts Reinforced

- Importing modules (`random`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Type conversion and input validation
- Feedback messages and iteration

##  How to Run the Game

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook:
   - `Python-Fundamentals.ipynb` (or `.py` version if exported)

2. Run the code in:
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Any local Python environment

##  Project Summary

This end-to-end project documents not only what I learned in Python but how I applied each concept in a cumulative and interactive way.  
The guessing game demonstrates a practical application of everything from variable handling and functions to user interaction and game logic.
